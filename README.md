I have participated in challenge and I will continue improving!

You can follow the commits flow to see how I refactoring.

Android developers face challenges almost everyday during development: performance, security, backwards compatibility, testing... And mainly refactoring for it's own or legacy code.
This repository contains a project to face an small challenge where the developer should add some new features, detect (and implement) patterns, add tests, re-think the architecture and do a clean code.

Game of Thrones for Android Challenge offers an app using an API to get data for [Game of Thrones][GameOfThronesLink] tv show. It's ready to run, it's working, but the code need to be improved. That's your challenge!

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android app that retrieve a list of some [Game of Thrones][GameOfThronesLink]' characters from an API. The app shows a list of the houses of the characters, the characters themselves and a detail description of each one.

This behaviour it's done in two different Activities, one for the two lists and other for details of the character:

![ScreenshotListCharacters][ScreenshotListCharacters]![ScreenshotListHouses][ScreenshotListHouses]![ScreenshotDetail][ScreenshotDetail]
* ``HomeActivity`` contains two Fragments in a ViewPager
  * `CharacterListFragment` shows a list of some the this tv show's characters.
  * `HouseListFragment` shows a list of the noble houses of the characters

* ``DetailActivity`` shows the name, photo and description of a character

## Goals

1. **Refactoring and practice TDD**
2. **Clean Architecture with MVP**
3. **Package by feature, not layer**
4. **Reactive with RxJava1**
5. **Play with Dagger2**
6. **Capability to work offline**
7. **Testing with Espresso and Mockito**
8. **Animations**
9. **Ui Chat**
